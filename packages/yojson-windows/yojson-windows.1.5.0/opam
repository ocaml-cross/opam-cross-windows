  "Yojson is an optimized parsing and printing library for the JSON format"
description: """
Yojson is an optimized parsing and printing library for the JSON format.

It addresses a few shortcomings of json-wheel including 2x speedup,
polymorphic variants and optional syntax for tuples and variants.

ydump is a pretty-printing command-line program provided with the
yojson package.

The program atdgen can be used to derive OCaml-JSON serializers and
deserializers from type definitions."""
